### Hi there üëã

üßÆ I'm **Louis / Famasito**, [@famasitweet](https://twitter.com/famasitweet), 
üì© [jagelouis@gmail.com](mailto:jagelouis@gmail.com?subject=J'aimerais%20disctuert%20avec%20vous%20de%20%20...).

I am in blockchain since 2021 and IT Student in Toulouse (BTS SIO).

ü§ù Very involved in the **Bitcoin** community as in the **Blockchain space**. 

I attended to [üëâ](https://www.nftparis.xyz/) [NFT Paris](https://www.nftparis.xyz/)

üß∞ I built some tools as [Telegram Converter Bot](https://github.com/GaloisField2718/SatoshiPriceBot), [Email saver for Bitcoin-dev Digest](https://github.com/GaloisField2718/Bitcoin-dev-digest) and few other you can find on my profile.

üßë‚Äçüíª Every hackathon has its own repository and I try to specify them in the description üí¨. Feel free to check some of them and fork it üç¥ as you need.

üßë‚Äçüéì Actual student in Master Computer Sciences, I hope to shape tomorrow Blockchain tools. 

üìÜ Actually mainly involved with new protocols on top of Bitcoin and projects on top of them : [Ordinals](https://github.com/ordinals/ord) and [Atomicals-js](https://github.com/atomicals/atomicals-js) for example. But I'm making some tests also on [Near Protocol](https://near.org), their command line is really cool and should be tested [near-cli-rs](https://github.com/near/near-cli-rs)

## Thanks üôè

Unfortunately [Rix AI | Hashnode](https://hasnode.com/rix) which were providing **Claude 2 AI** for free and available everywhere without limitations, is not available anymore... üò¢ I was a big fan, but I will need to take a subscription to ChatGPT üò≠ Or... [janhq/jan: Jan is an open source alternative to ChatGPT that runs 100% offline on your computer](https://github.com/janhq/jan) could be THE SOLUTION with [Mistral AI | Open-weight models](https://mistral.ai/) could do the job üòÑ

Thank you also to [nodeMonkes team](https://magiceden.io/ordinals/marketplace/nodemonkes) and [Rocktoshi](https://x.com/rocktoshi21?s=21) for sending me a nodeMonkes version of my pfp \

And also a BIG THANK YOU for all the community who are thinking, discussing and building on **Bitcoin** and **Blockchain Protocols**. The community is very kind with smart and interesting people. So, big thank you to everyone I have met and I hope to meet in the future ! üòò
